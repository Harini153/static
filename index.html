      <p>Java was formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate</p>
      <p> It is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass, at about 132,598.77 square kilometres (51,196.67 sq mi) (including Madura's 5,408.45 square kilometres (2,088.21 sq mi)). </p>
      <p> A chain of volcanic mountains is the east–west spine of the island.</p>

      <p>Java is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta</p>
      <p>The origins of the name "Java" are not clear. The island could possibly have been named after the jáwa-wut plant, which was said to be common in the island during the time, and that prior to Indianization the island had different names.[5] </p>

      <p>The great island of Iabadiu or Jabadiu was mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia composed around 150 CE in the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p>Iabadiu is said to mean "barley island", to be rich in gold, and have a silver town called Argyra at the west end. The name indicates Java[12] and seems to be derived from the Sanskrit name Java-dvipa (Yavadvipa).</p>

      <p>The annual news of Songshu and Liangshu (5th century CE) referred to Java as 闍婆 (She-pó or She-bó), He-ling (640–818), then called it She-po again until the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), where they began mentioning 爪哇 (Zhao-Wa or Chao-Wa).[13]</p>
      <p>According to Ma Huan's book (the Yingya Shenlan), the Chinese called Java Chao-Wa, and the island was called She-po in the past.[14] Sulaiman al-Tajir al-Sirafi mentioned two notable islands which separated Arabia and China:</p>
      <p>One is the 800 farsakh long Al-Rami, which is identified as Sumatra, and the other is Zabaj (Arabic: الزابج, Indonesian: Sabak), </p>
      <p>400 farsakh in length, identified as Java.[15]: 30–31  When John of Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months,</p>
      <p>When John of Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months, which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen; Saba may be his interpretation of She-bó.[16]: xii, 192–194  Afanasij Nikitin, a merchant from Tver (in Russia), traveled to India in 1466 and described the land of java, which he called шабайте (shabait/šabajte).[17][18]</p>
